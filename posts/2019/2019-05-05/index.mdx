# Introduction

Class is used to create Objects. It is not used directly by program logic.
main areas with a class definition:

- Instance property: what they have
- Instance method: what they do
  Example a Car class instance properties:
- Type: manual or automatic
- Brand:
- Weight
- Horse power

Instance properties would be:

- Start
- Stop
- Adjust speed

Constructor method:
Constructor is a method which is run once and only once when the object is being created.
It is used to setup the object. Acts like a normal function. We can console.log statements inside it.
Example we want to draw a Circle.

```js
class Circle {
  constructor(coordinate, radius) {
    this.x = coordinate.x;
    this.y = coordinate.y;
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.radius * this.radius * Math.PI;
  }

  printDescription() {
    console.log(`I am a Circle of radius ${this.radius}`);
  }
}

const Circle1 = new Circle({ x: 0, y: 0 }, 10);
console.log(Circle1);
```

So basically the Circle class serves as a template to create new objects. (Just like we used constructor function before).
The constructor function accepts parameters or arguments.

The instance properties for each object created would be different. Just like in classes in languages like python or C++.

Instance properties which is data relevant to each individual object that is created.
Instance methods are functions which uses instance properties to achieve an action or some sort of result based on each individual object being created from the class.

Many times the arguments that are passed to the constructor function are written as `_x`, `_y` that is preceded by an underscore (to indicate that they're not to be used directly).

## Getters and setters

Getters and setters are used to define methods in class which are then used as if they're properties.
They look like properties but they're methods of that class.

```js
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.radius * this.radius * Math.PI;
  }

  set area(area) {
    this.radius = Math.sqrt(area / Math.PI);
  }
}

circle1 = new Circle(10);
console.log(circle);
console.log(circle1.area);
// 314.1592653589793
circle1.area = 500;
console.log(circle1.radius);
// 12.6156626101008
```

We can use getter function to get the area of the circle (just like it was a property and not method)
Also we can use use the setter method to change the radius of circle. As we can see in the example above.
We can also create a new property in constructor called `numOfRequestsForArea` and then increment it in the getter function.

## Static methods

It is a method which is defined on a class but it is not a part of the instantiated object that has been created.
Basically they don't need an instance of a class to be created in order to be used.

A lot of these methods are helper methods. They're like utilities which are relevant to the class but they don't have an object bound.

```js
class Point {
  constructor(coordiantes) {
    this.x = coordiantes.x;
    this.y = coordiantes.y;
  }

  static samePosition(a, b) {
    return a.x === b.x && a.y === b.y;
  }
}

let point1 = new Point({ x: 10, y: 10 });
let point2 = new Point({ x: 10, y: 10 });
console.log(Point.samePosition(point1, point2));
```

We'll create a static method to compare area of two squares (the example used by the person doing the video)
Or we can find if both points are at the same position.

What would be a good practical use case for this?
Comparing two points whether they are at the same co-ordinates or not seems like a good use case. An external function might need to know if 2 points are at the same position and if so, just display one.

Basically a static function is used by the class and not an instance of class. We just pass the instances and in the implementation, we don't use `this`.

Another example could be `isValidDimensions` which checks if width and height are equal then it is a valid square.

```js
class Square {
  constructor(width) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
  static isValidDimensions(width, height) {
    return width === height;
  }
}
```

And then while using: `console.log(Square.isValidDimensions(6,6));`
Maybe before creating an actual instance of Square ie. an object square, we can check if it's valid dimensions. Or something like that. If valid dimensions then we create a square else we create a rectangle or something like that.

Don't require an instance of class to work. They're like helper functions.

### Inheritance and Extends

When you have a generic class and then create a new child class of the generic class while still maintaining its features and behaviours but a little bit extra.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

class Programmer extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, yearsOfExperience) {
    super(name, age);
    this.yearsOfExperience = yearsOfExperience;
  }

  code() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is coding`);
  }
}

let person1 = new Person('AJ', 34);
let programmer1 = new Programmer('Jo', 35, 12);
function developSoftware(programmers) {
  // Develop software
}
```

Suppose we have a `developSoftware` function which takes in a programmer as an argument.
`Programmer extends Person` means it takes in all attributes and behaviours of Person and has its own properties and behaviours.
This `Programmer` class has access to not only the properties in `Person` but also to the methods in `Person`.

Inside the child class, we have to call the parent constructor. We still have to assign the `name` and `age` but we can do it in a generic method by uding `super(name, age)` and rest will be custom behaviour of the `Programmer`.

This still works with the prototype chain. (we can see in `__proto__`)

If we call `person1.code()` we'll get an error and if we do `programmer.code()`
it'll work.

NOTE:: if we call `super(name, age)` in a constructor of a class which does not inherit from any other class, then we'll get an erro.

## Polymorphism

The act of redefining a method inside a derived child class. (Not really a very good definition I guess. I think what I'd learned in C++ was better )

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log('Make generic sound');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log('Cat meows');
  }
}

let a1 = new Animal('Cat');
let a2 = new Cat('Garfield');
console.log(a1.makeSound());
console.log(a2.makeSound());
```

We are achieving polymorphism here by overriding the method inside the child class.
If there was no `makeSound` method in `Cat` class, it would just print `Make generic sound`. So if we were unable to find a method in the child class, it would go and check the parent class and execute that method.

Calling `super` inside the child class.

```js
makeSound() {
  super.makeSound();
  console.log("Cat meows");
}
```

And in this case it'll execute the parent method and then the child method.
