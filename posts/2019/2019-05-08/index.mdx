## Object literals:

In JS almost everything is an Object.

```js
const s = 'Hello';
console.log(s.toUpperCase());
console.log(typeof s1); // string
const s2 = new String('Hello');
console.log(typeof s2); // object
```

This `s.toUpperCase()` seems to be an object but it is actually a string literal. And when we call a method on it, JS sort of wraps an object around it.
When we do `new String('Hello')` it creates an object and when we do `s1 = 'Hello'` that is a string literal and when we do something like `s1.toUpperCase()` it's doing `new String('')` thing behind the scenes. But by default it is a primitive.

We have things like DOM objects like : `window` which is the parent object of everything. It has a bunch of methods. One of the methods is `alert` which we can call on window like: `window.aler(1)`

In the browser, the DOM, there is nothing above `window`
Then we have `navigator` which is kind of like
`navigator` is part of the `window` object. But even when we don't write `window` it'll fall back on `window` object.
`console.log(navigator.appVersion);`

This can be a bit confusing but now we'll talk about `Object literals`

```js
const book1 = {
  title: 'Book One',
  author: 'John Doe',
  year: '2013',
};
```

In this book1 we can also put in a function as a property. Like so:

```js
const book1 = {
  title: 'Book One',
  author: 'John Doe',
  year: '2013',
  getSummary: function () {
    return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in the year ${this.year}`;
  },
};
```

`Object.values(book1)` to see the values of the Object literal in an array
`Object.keys(book2);` to see the keys of the Object.

Need to explore more of the OLOO pattern.

## Constructor functions

```js
function Book(title, author, year) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;
  this.getSummary = function () {
    return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in the year ${this.year}`;
  };
}

const book1 = new Book('B1', 'a1', '2013');
const book2 = new Book('B2', 'a2', '2013');
```

For `getSummary` we can do `this.getSummary = function() {}` inside our constructor function itself.
We don't need create the `getSummary` method again and again. (But I think in OLOO also it doesn't get created again and again. Will need to read it again)

## Prototypes

If we do the following:

```js
function Book(title, author, year) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;
}

Book.prototype.getSummary = function () {
  return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in the year ${this.year}`;
};

Book.prototype.revise = function (newYear) {
  this.year = newYear;
  this.revised = true;
};

const book1 = new Book('B1', 'a1', '2013');
const book2 = new Book('B2', 'a2', '2013');

console.log(book2);
book2.revise(2008);
console.log(book2);
```

Then when we `console.log(book2)` we don't see the `getSummary` method in there. It is inside `__proto__`.
We do want a title, author and year for every book but we don't want getSummary for every book. I think what he means is we don't want that function to be created again and again for every object. And want only one created and all `book objects` to use that.

## Inheritance with prototype

We want a magazine constructor which inherits from Book.

```js
function Book(title, author, year) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;
}

Book.prototype.getSummary = function() {
  return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in the year ${this.year}`;
}

// magazine constructor
function Magazine(title, author, year, month) {
  Book.call(this, title, author, year);

  this.month = month;
}

const mag1 = new Magazine('Mag One', 'John Doe', '2018' 'Jan');

console.log(mag1);

```

So now if we want to call `mag1.getSummary()`, we'll get an error.
What we need to do is we have to add the followsing:

```js
Magazine.prototype = Object.create(Book.prototype);
const mag1 = new Magazine('Mag One', 'John Doe', '2018' 'Jan')
console.log(mag1.getSummary)
```

NOTE: mag1 instantiating should be be after `Magazine.prototype = Object.create(Book.prototype);`

Right now if we look at the `__proto__` --> `__proto__` and we look at the constructor, we see that it uses the `Book` constructor. If we want it to use the `Magazine` constructor, we need to do:
`Magazine.prototype.constructor = Magazine`

So all in all, it looks like follows::

```js
function Book(title, author, year) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;
}

Book.prototype.getSummary = function () {
  return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in the year ${this.year}`;
};

// magazine constructor
function Magazine(title, author, year, month) {
  Book.call(this, title, author, year);

  this.month = month;
}

// Inherit from Book object using prototype
Magazine.prototype = Object.create(Book.prototype);
// Basically want the Magazine prototype to point to Book prototype

// Magazine prototype constructor should be Magazine not Book
Magazine.prototype.constructor = Magazine;
```

So basically doing inheritance with prototype (for constructor functions. Probably the same thing can work for object created by `Object.create`)

## Object.create

A different way to create objects.

First we need to create our object. There are various design patterns (we can use factory pattern)
But we want to keep this simple.

```js
// Object of Protos
const bookProtos = {
  getSummary: function () {
    return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in ${this.year}`;
  },
  getAge: function () {
    const years = new Date().getFullYear() - this.year;
    return `{this.title} is ${years} years old`;
  },
};
```

The way `bookProtos` has been created is simple. Just created an object of functions (I think this is a bit like how we did React before class syntax was used incorporated in JS and subsequently adopted into React.)

Now we'll create objects

```js
// Object of Protos
const bookProtos = {
  getSummary: function () {
    return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in ${this.year}`;
  },
  getAge: function () {
    const years = new Date().getFullYear() - this.year;
    return `{this.title} is ${years} years old`;
  },
};

const book1 = Object.create(bookProtos);
book1.title = 'Book One';
book1.author = 'John Doe';
book1.year = '2013';

console.log(book1);
```

Another way to create the object::

```js
const book1 = Object.create(bookProtos, {
  title: { value: 'Book One' },
  author: { value: 'John Doe' },
  year: { value: '2013' },
});
console.log(book1);
```
